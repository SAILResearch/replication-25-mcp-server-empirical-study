# Replication Package

This repository contains the replication data and scripts for the paper titled  
**"Model Context Protocol (MCP) at First Glance: Studying the Security and Maintainability of MCP Servers"**.  
It provides structured datasets and supporting materials for reproducing the study's analyses and results.

## ðŸ“¦ Contents

The repository includes the following datasets:

### 1. MCP Server List (Full Set)
- **Count:** 1,899 MCP servers
- **Description:** Combines both:
  - Official and community servers listed in [Anthropic's MCP repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers)
  - Additional MCP-compatible open source servers mined from GitHub

### 2. MCP Servers with Star Count > 10
- **Count:** 583 MCP servers
- **Description:** A curated subset of MCP servers that have gained significant developer attention on GitHub (i.e., more than 10 stars).
- **Includes:** Repository metadata and key maintainability metrics such as contributor count, issue count, commit activity, codebase size, and CI/CD metrics.

### 3. General-Purpose Vulnerabilities
- **Source:** Static analysis using **SonarQube**
- **Focus:** Standard vulnerability types such as insecure deserialization, SQL injection, command injection, and other high-severity issues.

### 4. MCP-Specific Tool Poisoning Reports
- **Source:** [mcp-scan](https://github.com/momentohq/mcp-scan)
- **Focus:** Identifies **tool poisoning** and other MCP-specific risks in codebases that expose or depend on model context manipulation.

### 5. Code Smells and Bugs
- **Source:** SonarQube
- **Focus:** Maintainability concerns such as complex code, duplicated logic, overly long methods, and latent bugs with severity `CRITICAL` or `BLOCKER`.

## ðŸ›  How to Use
